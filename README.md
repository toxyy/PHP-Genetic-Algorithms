# PHP Genetic Algorithms
 For a class I took a few years ago, nqueens and traveling salesmen.

Only nqueens and tsalesmen work. I do not plan on revisiting this unless I can think of a good reason to use genetic algorithms in PHP and I need my functions file again.

To run:

localhost/nqueens.php

localhost/tsalesmen.php

NOTE:

Tsalesmen takes a very long time to process. You will need to increase your maximum execution time.
